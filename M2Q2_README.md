# MaarjAM to QIIME2

This script and associated files use downloads from https://maarjam.botany.ut.ee/ to create an AM fungal fasta file and associated AM fungal taxonomy file to be uploaded into QIIME2 and used to BLAST consensus targeted SSU amplicons using AM fungal-specific primers. 

You can: 

1) use the script after downloading your own MaarjAM files to process for import into QIIME.
2) download my maarjam_dls folder and use the script to process those. 
3) download my 'clean' .qza (qiime2) files and simply run your consensus blast on your own denoised rep-seqs.qza file.
