# Microbial-ecology-things

I will attempt to continually upload scripts that got me to a place where I can look at and analyze my microbial data. The rate-limiting step in this field is likely the coding/bioinformatics. It's also sometimes the most stressful and gut-wrenchingly confusing, so this is my attempt to help every now and then. 

Enjoy!
